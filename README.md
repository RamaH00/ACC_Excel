# Customer Churn Analysis in Excel

This repository contains an Excel-based case study analyzing customer churn for a fictitious telecom company, Databel. The goal of this project is to investigate churn rates, identify reasons for churn, and provide actionable insights to reduce customer churn.

---

## **Project Overview**

### **Objective**
The primary objective of this analysis is to:
1. Calculate the churn rate for Databel's customer base.
2. Investigate the reasons behind customer churn.
3. Analyze churn patterns based on demographics, plan types, and customer behavior.
4. Create a dashboard to visualize key insights and metrics.

## **Datasets**
The analysis is based on two datasets:
1. **Databel – Customer**: Contains customer-level data, including demographics, churn status, and reasons for churn.
2. **Databel – Aggregate**: Provides aggregated views of the customer data.

## **Tasks Performed**

### **1. Exploratory Analysis**
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Cleaned and formatted the data.
  - Removed duplicate rows.
- **Churn Calculation**:
  - Converted the "Churn Label" column into a binomial column (1 for "Yes", 0 for "No").
  - Calculated the overall churn rate.
- **Churn Reasons**:
  - Created a column chart to visualize the reasons for churn.
- **Churn Categories**:
  - Identified the churn category with the highest proportion of churn.

### **2. Investigating Churn Patterns**
- **Demographics**:
  - Analyzed churn rates by demographic fields (e.g., age, gender, location).
- **Age Groups**:
  - Created age bins (e.g., 18-30, 31-45, etc.) and visualized churn rates by age group.
- **Unlimited Plan**:
  - Investigated the impact of unlimited data plans on churn.
- **International Calls**:
  - Analyzed the relationship between international calls and churn.
- **Contract Type**:
  - Explored how contract type and customer tenure affect churn.

### **3. Dashboard Creation**
- **KPIs**:
  - Added key metrics such as total customers, churned customers, and churn rate.
- **Churn Reasons**:
  - Highlighted the main reasons for churn, with a focus on competitor-related churn.
- **Demographics**:
  - Provided insights into the demographics of churned customers.
- **Consumption Data**:
  - Included data on customer usage (e.g., data usage, call minutes) to provide a complete picture of churn.

## **Key Insights**
1. **Churn Rate**: The overall churn rate is **26.86%**.
2. **Top Churn Reasons**:
   - Competitor offers (e.g., higher download speeds, more data).
   - Poor service quality.
3. **Demographics**:
   - Senior citizens and customers in certain states (e.g., California) have higher churn rates.
4. **Plan Types**:
   - Customers without unlimited data plans are more likely to churn.
5. **International Calls**:
   - Customers with international plans have a slightly higher churn rate.
